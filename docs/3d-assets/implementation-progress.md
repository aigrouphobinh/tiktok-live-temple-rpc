# 3D Sanctuary Implementation Progress

Updated: 2026-11-01

## Implemented on `main`

- `7a28894` — courtyard tile field now uses two `THREE.InstancedMesh` batches instead of hundreds of individual tile meshes. This is a draw-call reduction only; actual frame-rate impact still needs browser profiling.
- `3a6f2cc` — replaced the flat eave strips with two curved roof surfaces, raised corner profiles, low-count longitudinal tile seams, a ridge cap and end finials. Procedural geometry only; it is not a scanned or authored temple asset.
- `07621a3` — shortened the roof surface to the rear half and moved the ridge cap so the fixed +Z camera has an open sightline into the main hall. This is a camera-occlusion precaution; visual confirmation is still pending.
- `71bcdb9` — moved roof boundary constants into the outer scope so ridge/finial construction can reference them safely.
- `99b07f3` — added a separate foreground offering table with bronze incense vessel and sticks, paired lotus vases, fruit offerings and butter-lamp flames. Procedural meshes; no external assets.
- `0cb53cb` — added two soft altar spotlights, a warm fill light, and subtle animated candle/altar glow. Spotlights do not cast shadows to avoid extra mobile GPU shadow passes.
- `8381713` — added 3D world-space gift reactions: rocket projectile and explosion sparks, flying green dragon/gust, spinning donut with ring trail, and rising rose bloom/petals. Existing 2D gift effects and audio remain intact; no camera movement is added.
- `f05d61c`–`2bb7c0f` — corrected the idle-altar gift path: a gift now owns the state-machine effect lifecycle even when no devotee is active, and a dedicated `temple:gift-action` event drives the 3D reaction exactly once when each effect starts (including queued effects). The character-interruption event remains reserved for actual devotee interruptions.
- `4a69b83` — recorded a 10th-century Thai seated Buddha scan listed as CC0 in the Artheon collection as a candidate only; its individual record, file and visual suitability remain to be checked.
- `7a28894` — added a rear altar screen with red lacquer panels, gold framing, lattice relief and a central medallion to give the Buddha focal plane more depth.
- `4a077fe` — expanded the asset inventory with an East Asian ceremonial hall candidate pack and Buddhist sculpture scan collection. Both remain candidates, not integrated runtime assets.
- `d309611` — added CI source guards for the instanced courtyard and altar screen.
- `3ccaefa` — added CI source guards for the curved roof geometry.
- `8867574` — added CI source guards for the open near-side roof/camera sightline.
- `5c2153b` — added a CI scope-order guard for roof boundary constants before ridge construction.
- `eafcd62` — added CI source guards for the offering table, incense vessel and lotus vases.
- `606039c` — added CI source guards for altar spotlights and candle flicker.
- `99c7feb` — added CI source guards for all four 3D gift actions and the interruption-event bridge.

## Preserved requirements

- Three.js remains opt-in via `?3d=1`; 2D remains the fallback.
- Existing camera position and fixed elevated main-hall composition are unchanged.
- The separate camera director still selects one subtle preset at ritual start and returns to the master view; gifts do not direct the camera.
- Gift priority, coalescing, and the bounded effect queue remain intact. The 3D scene listens to the dedicated `temple:gift-action` lifecycle event; camera/character interruption remains separate and is emitted only when a devotee was actually active.

## Not yet verified

- No third-party GLB has been downloaded, vendored, or loaded by the runtime.
- No actual browser screenshot or WebGL visual inspection has been performed for these latest changes.
- No mobile GPU/frame-time/draw-call profile has been recorded.
- No real TikTok LIVE payload test has been performed.
- The GitHub workflow wrapper available here only returns PR-triggered runs for a commit; it returned an empty list for the push commit. Check the repository Actions page for the push-triggered CI result.

## Next work

1. Visually inspect the open-roof sightline, curved roof, offering props and layered altar lighting from the fixed elevated camera.
2. Inspect the individual Thai seated Buddha CC0 record and file; integrate only after pose, license, scale and texture checks.
3. Replace the primitive Buddha blockout with a reviewed, correctly licensed seated Buddha GLB or a higher-quality custom model.
4. Replace the placeholder devotees with a rigged, respectful lay-devotee model while preserving the existing ritual timings and animation events.
5. Add asset loading failure handling and performance budgets, then perform actual browser/device validation.
6. Verify 3D gift reaction timing and composition in-browser alongside the existing CSS effects; tune depth/scale only after visual inspection.
7. Test rocket, dragon, donut and rose payloads both with an active devotee and with an empty altar; confirm one 3D reaction per started effect and no camera movement.
